## YOLO model's supplementary files

The best model is in [weights](https://github.com/SteveKola/Sign-to-Speech-for-Sign-Language-Understanding/tree/master/savedmodels_configs/yolo_model/weights) directory. 

The hyperparameter settings are in [hyp.yaml](https://github.com/SteveKola/Sign-to-Speech-for-Sign-Language-Understanding/blob/master/savedmodels_configs/yolo_model/hyp.yaml) and [opt.yaml](https://github.com/SteveKola/Sign-to-Speech-for-Sign-Language-Understanding/blob/master/savedmodels_configs/yolo_model/opt.yaml) files.

[results.txt](https://github.com/SteveKola/Sign-to-Speech-for-Sign-Language-Understanding/blob/master/savedmodels_configs/yolo_model/results.txt) stores the loss and evaluation metrics' values as training progressed.

All `jpg` and `png` files are for model performance's evaluation.
